Simple News App using NewsAPI.org API/JSON Data

This is a simple news app that uses an API to retrieve json metadata and populates the page with the first 5 news stories from the selected news source/blog. Currently there are only four sources listed however NewsAPI.org provides up to 70 news sources which can be easliy added for more news options. 

Depending on news provider, some feeds can be set to sort stories by: top, latest, and popular. The IGN feed has been set to the top news, while the first 3 sources are set to provide the latest news feed. This particular version allows posts with a maximum of 5 stories at a time, however this can be easily increased or decreased. 

The app was created while completing one of Codecademy's javascript projects. This page is a modified version of my original solution to the project and was created for addtional practice. The twitter.js and sha1.js files were provided by codecademy and not created by myself.
